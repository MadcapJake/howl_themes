# Howl Themes

Theme bundle for the Howl editor (http://howl.io/)

## Installation

Clone or download into `~/.howl/bundles`. Please save it under a different folder name because I forgot that the official Howl themes bundle is already named `howl_themes`. I have it under `custom_themes` for example.

The colors might change over time, as I am tweaking themes to my liking.

## Contains

- Berrykai - Tweaked blue-ish Monokai
- Play - Built upon Monokai but light with a background pattern

## Patterns

They're from http://subtlepatterns.com/, I didn't make them.
