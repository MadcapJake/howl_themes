# Howl Adapta Themes

Theme bundle for the Howl editor (http://howl.io/)

## Installation

Clone or download into `~/.howl/bundles`.

The colors might change over time, as I am tweaking them to my liking.

You may also just copy paste this:
```sh
cd ~/.howl/bundles
git clone https://github.com/madcapjake/madcap_themes
```
